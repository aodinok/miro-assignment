Bundle is usually ignored from Git, but as part of requirements I've added it.
So example should work immediately after `npm i`.

Quick Start
-----
- `npm i`
- `npm run example`

Tasks
-----

- `npm run build`: prepare bundle
- `npm run test`: run tests
- `npm run example`: open example index.html in default browser
- `npm run docs`: open auto generated documentation for API
